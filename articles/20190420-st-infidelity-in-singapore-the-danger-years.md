He started exercising and giving himself a makeover. His sudden transformation raised his wife's suspicions and she found out he was having an affair.

A private investigator revealed that he was indeed cheating on her - not with a woman like she had thought, but with a man. The couple, as well as the third party, were in their 30s and early 40s.

Counsellors and lawyers The Straits Times spoke to in the wake of the Hong Kong scandal, where married singer Andy Hui, 51, was filmed kissing actress Jacqueline Wong, 30, in a taxi, said infidelity cases here tend to involve couples in their 30s and 40s.

The median ages for male and female divorcees in Singapore were 43.2 years and 39.1 years respectively in 2017.

They usually have older school-going children and elderly parents. With attention focused on other aspects of family life instead of the marriage, some might stray.

Counselling groups said they have seen a marked increase in cases involving infidelity over the past three years.

Reach Counselling Centre dealt with 193 cases of couples affected by extramarital affairs last year, making up 40 per cent of its total counselling cases. The organisation said these cases have been on the rise over the past few years.

Such cases at Focus on the Family Singapore more than doubled last year compared with 2016.

Touch Family Services also reported seeing more cases over the past three years, based on the inquiries it received.

Many of these affairs occur with colleagues after working or socialising in close range.

This is especially so because Singaporeans spend a lot of time in the office and meeting clients.

Senior counsellor Winny Lu of Reach Counselling Centre said individuals might also be going through a mid-life crisis.

"Typically, these affairs are a result of a lack of satisfaction in the marriage itself, perhaps due to a lack of quality couple time," she said. "Like the Hong Kong celebrities, those who cheat may spend time with another party at work and develop feelings. What the original relationship lacks, they look for in a new partner."

Senior counsellor Elysia Tan from Touch Family Services said weak boundaries set with the opposite sex is perhaps the biggest reason for infidelity.

"Not having clear physical and emotional boundaries with the opposite sex, set either by themselves or with their spouse, might lead to them being caught in situations where they might find themselves being vulnerable and intimate with the opposite sex," she said.

What are the chances of marital recovery?

Counsellors said couples can recover if both husband and wife have the intention to save the marriage. In the case of the Hong Kong celebrities, the partners of Mr Hui and Ms Wong have demonstrated an interest in continuing their respective relationships.

Pop star Sammi Cheng, who is married to Mr Hui, said in an Instagram post on Thursday that they held hands and prayed together.

Ms Cheng, 46, described the incident as "an important lesson in our marriage". Meanwhile, Ms Wong's boyfriend of three years, actor Kenneth Ma, 45, defended her.

This willingness to work through the issues can be supplemented with counselling.

Reach Counselling Centre's Ms Lu said: "Therapy not only helps the spouse who has been cheated on to process negative emotions, but it also helps the one who cheated to manage the spouse's roller-coaster of emotions during this difficult period."

Counsellors act as facilitators for couples to discover the reasons behind the relationship developing into such a vulnerable state. From there, they can decide whether or not they are willing to put in the effort to improve the relationship.

Ms Lu added that the percentage of couples who reconcile after counselling is higher than those who do not.

Private counsellor James Leong of Listen Without Prejudice said clients who have a religion, such as in the case of Ms Cheng, the pop star, tend to cope better. "And that is because they don't focus on their identities or values as a 'failed' son, husband or father, but in their identity as a child of God," he said.

Nonetheless, while reconciliation might be successful, such dalliances have long-term repercussions on victims. Some might not be able to sleep at night and may suffer from regular flashbacks of incriminating text messages and photos they might have seen of the affair.

There were 7,578 marriages that ended in divorce or annulment in 2017. Official statistics do not reflect the actual number of infidelity cases since many couples choose to file for divorce on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour instead of adultery, where a higher level of proof is needed to show evidence of sexual relations outside a marriage.

This evidence might take the form of admission from a cheating spouse or a private investigator's report.

Mr Lim Chong Boon, head of family law at PKWA Law Practice, said: "The numbers do not reflect the true situation on the ground. Both parties usually agree to an amicable divorce rather than go through more sensational grounds."

About a third of his firm's clients go in with suspicions of infidelity: "People can put up with a partner's issues like gambling but the last straw is usually cheating."

Ms Michelle Woodworth, director of law practice Quahe Woo and Palmer, said one case stood out as particularly distressing for her.

She was representing a woman who discovered that her husband had raped their maid. "It was a heart-wrenching situation. It was rape, there was no consent. For the wife, it was devastating. You don't enter a marriage hoping this day will ever come."

Divorce proceedings are emotionally draining but because the Singapore court system is pro-mediation and settlement, situations are usually resolved rather amicably for the good of everyone involved.

Ms Woodworth said: "As lawyers, we try to help the parties to, at the very least, retain control of how their lives are going to look like post-divorce by helping to steer them away from further conflict. We are duty-bound to inform clients of all available dispute resolution options."

Technology and social media make it easier today to catch a cheating spouse - they might get tagged in suspicious photos or posts on Facebook or Instagram, noted Withers KhattarWong's matrimonial partner Sharanjit Kaur.

Lawyers said they have also been noticing more women straying and cheating on their husbands compared with 15 years ago. Some reported that the number of women cheating is on a par with men, standing at 50 per cent of their clients compared with 30 per cent in the past.

Lawyer Gloria James-Civetta gave the example of a husband who found out through his homemaker wife's computer that she had been streaming herself cleaning their house in the nude for the viewing pleasure of men for a fee.

Lawyer Rajan Chettiar added that the rising trend of unfaithful wives could also be attributed to the increasing number of women doing well in the corporate world. "The chances of them meeting someone else at work or while conducting business is pretty high," he said.

Ms Kaur noted there are many support groups for adulterers and their spouses. Counselling centres dot the island while religious groups, clan associations and gender-based support groups also offer aid.

Ms Lu, the senior counsellor, gave the example of how the Torn Asunder Affair Recovery Programme and Marriage Counselling, which the Reach Counselling Centre offers, was able to help a couple where the wife had started seeing her boss who was 10 years older than her because she felt she could "talk and connect intellectually with him". The husband and wife pair had been dating for 11 years before getting married.

The programme, said Ms Lu, was able to help and guide the unfaithful spouse to show sincere remorse as well as encourage both partners to take responsibility for their own contributions to the decline of the marriage, seek forgiveness and change their ways to reconnect.
